2. Install gurobi (see www.gurobi.com)

Usage
=====

1. Download store information

  $ python bin/main.py stores \
    --output stores.json

2. Download part prices

  $ python bin/main.py price_guide \
    --parts-list parts.bsx \
    --store-list stores.json \
    --output price_guide.json

3. Find stores to use

  $ gurobi.sh bin/main.py minimize \
    --parts-list parts.bsx \
    --price-guide price_guide.json \
    --store-list data/stores.json \
    --shipping-cost 20.0 \          # estimated cost to ship from any store
    --target-country USA \          # only use stores that ship here
    --feedback 20 \                 # minimum feedback rating
    --output recommendations

4. Create BrickLink Wanted Lists

  $ python bin/main.py wanted_list \
    --recommendation recommendations.json \
    --output wanted.xml

During this step, the program will prompt you to create wanted lists on
bricklink with specific names. Go to www.bricklink.com/wantedView.asp and enter
those names in the "Add New Wanted List" area, then copy/paste the ID of the
new list back into the program and press Enter. Each of these names is the user
ID of one shop owner.

5. Go to www.bricklink.com/wantedXML.asp and upload wanted.xml. If you entered
the correct Wanted List IDs in the previous steps, you should have no issues
here.

6. Go to www.bricklink.com/wantedShop.asp and uncheck all but one wanted list.

Remember the Wanted List name.  For example, if a list is named "My edeevo
Wanted List (4)", remember "edeevo".

Click on the link for the first store listed. Then look at your URL bar and
change,
  ...p=<owner name>&...
to
  ...p=<wanted list name>&...
This will take you to the store for this Wanted List.

7. Click the BrickRake bookmarklet in your browser toolbar. You should see
quantities appear in each box.  Go to the bottom of the page and click "Add
Selected Items to Shopping Cart". Double check to ensure that there are no
parts that couldn't be added (this can happen, for example, if parts are only
sold in sets of 2).

8. Buy buy buy!
